## CBS IDE

The CBS IDE supports generating editors and translators for languages
from their specifications in the CBS frameowrk.

### Spoofax

The CBS IDE is implemented as a language project in the 
[Spoofax](https://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/)
language workbench.

- Download [Spoofax 2.5.16](https://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/release/note/2.5.16.html#downloads).
- See [Installing Spoofax](https://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/install.html).
- Before opening,
  [increase the Eclipse memory](https://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/install.html#changing-eclipse-memory-allocation) (preferably to 6G, but at least 4G).
- View the Spoofax console:
  `Window: Show view: Other: General: Console`.

#### Sunshine

You can run Spoofax menu actions in batch mode using the Sunshine JAR command line utility.

- Download [Sunshine JAR for Spoofax 2.5.16](https://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/release/note/2.5.16.html#command-line-utilities)
- Run `java -jar YOUR-PATH-TO-SUNSHINE-JAR --help` for a list of available options

(Sunshine is *not* needed for interactive use of Spoofax.)

#### MacOS Catalina and Big Sur

To build editors and translators generated by the CBS IDE:

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- Install [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)
- Open the Spoofax app from a terminal (instead of double-clicking its icon)

### CBS language project 

Download the [prototype branch](https://github.com/plancomps/cbs-beta-tools/tree/prototype) 
of the **cbs-beta-tools** repository.

{:.note}
> The **cbs-beta-tools** repository is currently private.
> To request access, email your name, affiliation, and GitHub name to 
> [plancomps@gmail.com](mailto:plancomps@gmail.com).
  
- Import CBS into Spoofax as a *Maven* project.
  The version number in `pom.xml` and `.mvn/extensions.xml` needs to match
  the Spoofax version number (2.5.16).

- In case of Maven errors:
  
    - Right-click the project
    - Select `Maven > Update project...`
    - Check `Force Update of Snapshots/Releases`
    - Click `OK`  
  
- Build the CBS language project (it can take 3â€“4 minutes).

### CBS-beta repository
  
The CBS-beta repository includes *collections of funcon definitions* as projects.
These are reused in language specifications using symbolic links.
  
The repository also contains *illustrative language specifications* as projects.
These projects are independent of each other.
  
You can browse all specifications in the CBS-beta repository online
on the [CBS-beta] website,
as source files, web pages, and PDFs.
For local browsing,
download the [math branch] of the repository.
To serve the web pages locally,
install the [Jekyll] static website generator.
  
## Funcon interpreters

Apart from running funcon terms directly,
funcon interpreters can run programs via their translation to funcons.

Install [Funcons-Tools 0.2.11](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/funcons-tools).

Installation requires the 
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) and
[Cabal toolchain](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/getting-started.html).

## LaTeX

The CBS IDE can generate LaTeX from (literate) CBS specifications.
To produce PDFs, 
install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/),
or use an online LaTeX editor such as
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
